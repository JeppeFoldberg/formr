Title: formr survey framework
Description: The formr R package provides a few convenience functions 
	that may be useful to the users of formr (formr.org), an online 
	survey framework which heavily relies on R via openCPU. 
	Some of the functions are for conveniently generating individual 
	feedback graphics, some are just shorthands to make certain common 
	operations in formr more palatable to R novices.
